				<li><span>Species</span>: Eagles are birds of prey in the family Accipitridae; there are approximately 60 different species.
					 <!-- The majority are found in Eurasia and Africa, with only 14 species found in other areas including North, Central and South America, and Australia. -->
				<li><span>Feeding</span>: Eagles are apex predators, meaning they are at the top of the food chain. What eagles eat depends upon the species and the food that is available to them, but they are all carnivorous and live on a diet of meat and/or fish.</li>
				<li><span>Sexual Relationship</span>: Eagles are monogamous, so generally mate for life. They have strong site fidelity, so a mating pair tend to reuse the same nest year after year.</li>
				<li><span>Vision</span>: Sight is the strongest of all eagle senses. The eyes are large, can take up almost 50% of the head, and can weigh the same amount as a human eye. An eagles vision is 4–5 times better than that of a human.</li>

			<p>With the exception of some vultures, eagles are generally larger than other birds of prey. They have strong muscular legs, powerful talons and large hooked beaks that enable them to rip the flesh from their prey.

<!-- Eagles vary in size. One of the smallest species, the little eagle, is around 17.7–21.7 in (45–55 cm). In contrast, Stellers’s sea eagle is around 36–42 in (91–106 cm) in size, and wingspan can reach approximately 72–96 in (2–2.5 m). --></p>
