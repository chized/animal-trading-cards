# animal-trading-cards
I did this a few years ago, even though I just pushed it to github
It was a codeshool project done to teach how to make beautiful designs with HTML AND CSS
It is a simple animal trading card that showcases different animals in a cards,
The deatils of these animals. their species, characteristics, feeding,
Sexual relationship and more is displayed on the card
you can replicate the project if you want to make something similar
